Planning and To Do


First user story:

As an air traffic controller
So I can get passengers to a destination
I want to instruct a plane to land at an airport


Airport => .land => register the landing


To do

- Create an Airport class
- create .land method
- create an array where you can register the plane
- add the landing plane for the register
- create a .show_register method to show the register
